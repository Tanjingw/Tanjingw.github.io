This paper empirically analyses the impact of cities having high-speed railways(HSR) on the rural migrants' willingness to settle in the working city. Using data from the 2016 and 2017 China Migrants Dynamic Survey. The results of the linear probability model show that cities with HSR can increase the intention to settle of the migrants by 5.73%. The counterfactuals were constructed using three matching models: Entropy Balancing Matching (EBM), Coarsened Exact Matching (CEM) and Propensity Score Matching (PSM), all of which supported the baseline results. Two geographical variables, elevation and slope, were also used as instruments for the HSR cities to avoid potential endogeneity affecting the robustness. In addition, the mechanism analysis shows that the greater the number of relatives accompanying the migrants, the less willingness to settle is affected by HSR, while the greater the distance they move or the more they own land assets in their hometown, the greater their willingness to settle is affected by HSR. The analysis of regional heterogeneity shows that the HSR in cities in Northeast China does not have a significant effect on migrants' settlement intentions, while this mechanism is significant in all other regions of China. This paper provides micro-level evidence of this mechanism by examining the impact of transport infrastructure on migrants settlement intentions in China in both theoretical and empirical dimensions.
