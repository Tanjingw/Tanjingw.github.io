The navigation of the Three Gorges is of strategic importance in improving the modern transportation network and facilitating the flow of resources within the Yangtze River basin. This paper explores the economic effects and mechanisms of the navigation of the Three Gorges permanent locks on the prefecture-level cities in the Yangtze River basin using quasi-natural experiments and satellite lighting data as a proxy variable for economic levels by means of the difference-in-differences (DID) and difference-in-difference-in-differences (DDD). The results show that: (1) the economic level of cities increased significantly after the navigation of the Three Gorges, with a certain time lag effect; (2) the navigation of the Three Gorges promoted the development of the tertiary industry and further optimised the industrial structure; (3) the navigation of the Three Gorges significantly boosted the domestic freight capacity, providing strong support for releasing land transport resources and accelerating the flow of resources between Yangtze River basin.
