The construction of transport infrastructure can promote economic and trade development and attract international capital. The Yangtze River is the golden waterway in China, and the Three Gorges ship lock is an important shipping facility on Yangtze river. Based on the quasi-natural experiment on the open of Three Gorges ship lock, this paper investigates the impact of the Yangtze River's navigation on the attraction of international capital by neighbouring cities using the Difference in Differences (DID) model. The results show that the Yangtze River's navigation increases the level of foreign capital utilisation by cities along the river by 20.4%. The mechanism analysis shows that the Yangtze River navigation not only enhances the total amount of freight transport in the cities along the river and promotes the development of industrial enterprises, but also improves the financial pressure of the neighbouring cities along the Yangtze River and enhances the consumption capacity of the cities.
