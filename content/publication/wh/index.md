This paper analyses the impact of the migrants' working hours in the inflow city on their settlement intentions using 2017 China migrants dynamic survey (CMDS) data of 117,152 employed samples. The results of the linear probability model (LPM) show that for each 1\% increase in the working hours of the migrant population, their settlement intention decreases by 0.0391\%. This paper uses "labor union" and "chronic disease" as instruments for working hours to avoid potential endogeneity affecting the robustness. The results of the mechanistic analysis show that an increase in housing expenditures weakens the effect of labour time on migrants' willingness to settle, while an increase in income and the income-expenditure ratio strengthens the effect of labour time on migrants' willingness to settle. In addition, decomposition using the KHB method found that social integration partially mediates the effect of this mechanism. Heterogeneity analysis reveals that the settlement intentions of female, low-educated, and married migrants are more likely to be influenced by labour hours. Intention to settle is not sensitive to labour hours for agricultural migrants, and is sensitive to labour hours for industrial and service migrants.
